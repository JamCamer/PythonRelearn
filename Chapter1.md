The first step to solving problems with a computer is to clearly state the problem

Programs are converted into a set of numbers called machine code

The problems solved in this chapter will be guess a number and rock paper scissors

Guess the number
1. Computer selects a number
2. Computer asks the player to guess
3. The guest guesses the number and the computer reads it
4. the computer compares input number against selected number if input = selected then player wins else
5. Computer responds with messgae that player is too high or too low.
6. Repeat step 2

Rock Paper scissors
1. Select random choice from options Rock, Paper, Scissor. Save in variable Choice
2. Ask Player for their Choice 1=Rock, 2=Scissor, 3=Paper
3. Player selection into variable player
4. IF player=choice 
5.  Print Tie
6. Step 1
7.If player = rock
8. If choice is equal paper step 17
9. Else go to step 18
10.If player = Paper
11. If choice is equal Scissor step 17
12. Else go to step 18
13.If player = Scissor
14. If choice is equal Rock step 17
15. Else go to step 18
16. Print error and terminate
17. Computer wins and terminate
18. Print player wins and terminate

Variables are ways programmers can store information see the example hello world, a variable can hold oned value
