In python an if statement begins with the word if , followed by a logical expression that evaluates to True or False followed by a colon :

if True:         #Constant
if flag:         #Logical variable
if a > b:        #relational expression
if a>b and c>d:  #logical combination

The consequent is the action that is taken after a logical if statement

if a>b:
    a = a+1
    b = b-1
c = a-b

Indentations mean nothing to the computer when using Java this is mainly used for humans to read

The easier a program is to read the easier the program is to debug and maintain

An if is a two way or binary decision, if statements are crucial to get a guess the number game working,

Else is always preceeded by an if statement, therefore the else is part of an if, an else is only executed when a condition is false
