3.26.2025 A new start. TOday I begin a 15 minute learning module.

Time to create a variable with a interger 
var=1 is a real interger
var=1.0 is a floating point interger

Mixing intergers and real numbers is not a great idea but we can use () to specify how expressions are to be evaluated

float operations  involve working with floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a decimal point. These operations are fundamental for various calculations, especially in scientific and engineering applications. Here's an overview of common float operations in Python:

Floats can be used as conversions 
float(): Converts an integer or a string representation of a number to a float (e.g., float(5) or float("3.14")).
int(): Converts a float to an integer by truncating the decimal part (e.g., int(3.9)).
round(): Converts a float to nearest real round(3.5)= 4

Truncating in Python refers to shortening or cutting off a piece of data, such as a string or a file.

0o is base octal

If we want to calculate a radius of a circle in python

radius = float(input())

The input accepts a keyboard number input by user

Understanding error messages is the key to understanding python programming

Type error is a decription it can mean that something cannot preform a function say multiplying a string

python operates off logical statements usually if then
